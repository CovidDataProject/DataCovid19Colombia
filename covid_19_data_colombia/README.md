# Novel Coronavirus Dataset by The COVID-19 Colombia Project

**The COVID-19 Colombia Project** is releasing a series of data files with cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in Colombia, at the department, municipalities, and cities level, over time. We are compiling this data from the Ministry of Health (MINSALUD) and local news to provide a complete record of the ongoing outbreak.

The data record begins with the first reported coronavirus case in BOGOTA on Mar. 06, 2020. These data are being made available to the public interested as well as researchers, scientists, and government officials who would like to understand the outbreak better. The databases can be used to power any dashboard and serve in reporting tracking the virus.

This novel coronavirus dataset contains the two follow folders: 

* **[covid_19_daily_reports](covid_19_daily_reports):** Presents a set of detailed daily files with epidemiological indicators such as mortality rate, hospitalization rate, active cases (active = confirmed - recovered - deaths), and total people hospitalized (in Hospital + ICU), among others. These indicators are determined for each city or municipality in Colombia.

* **[covid_19_time_series](covid_19_time_series):** Show three time-series files related to the cases confirmed, death, and recovered, respectively. For each file, each column of data includes the cumulative count from cases during the day.

All the files proposed of both folders contain a standard geographic identifier (latitude and longitude), to make it easier for an analyst to combine this data with other data sets like a map file or population data. Also, all the datasets are derived from the daily case reports and will be updated daily.
