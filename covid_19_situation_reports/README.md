# COVID-19 Situation Reports by MINSALUD

This folder contains the COVID-19 official's reports provided by the MINSALUD and INS. We create this folder like an excellent complement to our daily report.

Please now refer to the data provided in the two follow folders: "[minsalud_covid_19_sit_rep_csvs](minsalud_covid_19_sit_rep_csvs)" and "[minsalud_covid_19_sit_rep_pdfs](minsalud_covid_19_sit_rep_pdfs)". The first one shows the COVID-19 official' reports in .csv format. The second one presents in .pdf format the daily situation reports. Both delivered through at official web sites and communications media.

Additionally, there is the file [minsalud_covid_19_sit_rep.csv](minsalud_covid_19_sit_rep.csv) with the summary of the daily official reports.

These files have been cleaned and re-formatted to address inconsistencies in the time zone, update frequency, among other things more. 

**Additional Notes**

**Time Zone:** The MINSALUD report in Bogotá, Colombia time (UTC -5). All data in this folder is in UTC -5.

**Update Frequency:** We maintain this dataset daily at the same moment MINSALUD delivers the official COVID-19 situation reports.
