# Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by The COVID-19 Colombia Project

This is the data repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (formerly known as 2019-nCoV infection or simply COVID-19). The main objective of this repository is to facilitate access to COVID-19 data in Colombia to bring a more comprehensive picture of the current situation.

[The COVID-19 Colombia Project](https://coviddataproject.com/) designed this data repository for tracking the evolution of the 2019-nCoV in Colombia. These datasets it is being made available to the public interested (researchers, scientists, news media, and government officials) who would like to understand the outbreak better. 

The repository databases can be used to power any dashboard and serve to report tracking the virus in all departments, municipalities, and cities from Colombia. 

## Data Sources:

* **Datos Abiertos Colombia:** https://www.datos.gov.co/
* **Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS):** https://www.ins.gov.co/
* **Ministerio de Salud (MINSALUD):** https://www.minsalud.gov.co/
* **Ministerio de Tecnologías de la Información y las Comunicaciones (MINTIC):** https://www.mintic.gov.co/


# Methodology

The data is the product of professionals working across several cities from Colombia, that monitor local news and analyze official data releases. It is also a response to the official reports of INS and MINSALUD that, on several occasions, have corrected information hours or days after first reporting it. At times, cases have moved a patient first identified in municipality or city to another, often with no explanation. These instances have become more common as the number of cases in Colombia has grown.

For those reasons, our data will, in some cases, not exactly match the information reported. Those differences include, among others, these cases: 

* The Ministry of Health (MISALUD) did not publish cases official report on March 12, 2020 (official reports were only on March 11 and 13). After several days, he assigned some confirmed cases from March 11 and 13 to March 12.

* The total cases reported by the government on March 21, 22, and 23, 2020, do not coincide with those presented in the database available in INS. In some cases, there have been changes in the dates of diagnosis.

* Sometimes patients diagnosed with COVIC-19 are observed in a different municipality than the one reported days later. This situation has happened, among others, in some municipalities of the department of Antioquia.

* The first coronavirus death in Colombia occurred on March 16, 2020, in the city of Cartagena de Indias. This case was officially reported on March 21, but days later it appears published on March 22 in the database available in INS.
